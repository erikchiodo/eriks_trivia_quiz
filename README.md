## Description

The goal of this Challenge was to create a trivia quiz.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:

    > WHEN I click the start button
    > THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

    > WHEN I answer a question
    > THEN I am presented with another question

    > WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    > THEN time is subtracted from the clock

    > WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    > THEN the game is over

    > WHEN the game is over
    > THEN I can save my initials and score
